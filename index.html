Also, the story is impressively hyper-local while maintaining broad resonance</p></li> 
		<li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/09/twenty-years-gone-911-bobby-mcilvaine/619490/"> What Bobby McIlvaine Left Behind, <i> The Atlantic </i></a> <p> I kind of wish all tragedies could receive this degree of attention. An excellent portrait of the human toll of trauma that lingers long after an event is no longer top of mind.</p></li>
		<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4e50SANzFwvHyKmo5WdtAh?si=d2cad65e00d94e56"> Gangster Capitalism (Podcast)</a> <p> This podcast is really in depth and textured explanation of life at Liberty University. It covers all angles and who doesn't love evangelical Christians behaving badly</p></li>
		<li> <a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/community-newsmaker-metric-media-local-news.php"> Advocacy groups and Metric Media collaborate on local ‘community news,'<i> Columbia Journalism Review</i> </a><p> I really love this piece for how instructive it is. The researchers show their work investigating these publications in-depth and it's exactly the kind of work I'd like to do. </p></li>
		<li> <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-is-roblox-video-game-app-metaverse-safe-children-ban.html"> It’s 10 p.m. Do You Know Where on Roblox Your Children Are? <i> New York Magazine </i> </a> <p> There were two stories about Roblox recently, and I thought this was the better one. I was really impressed the writer could get access to kids who play Roblox, which really made the story.</p></li>
